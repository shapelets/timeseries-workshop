# EnerNOC GreenButton Data

This is anonymized 5-minute energy usage data for 100 commercial/ industrial sites for 
2012. Actual reading values and identifying information such as geo coordinates and 
square footage have been anonymized, but the values have been skewed by a linear magnitude
so that comparisons over time and between sites will remain consistent.

This data export contains the following information:

## GZip Archives

Data has been packaged into archives for easy download:

* all-data.tar.gz contains CSV, greenbutton and metadata
* csv-only.tar.gz contains CSV and metadata
* greenbutton-only.tar.gz contains greenbutton XML and metatdata


## Meta

The meta folder contains two files: one in CSV format, and the same information in
YAML.  These files contain site metadata for each site ID including industry, 
square footage, lat/lng and timezone.  Note that because lat/lng are randomized by a 
small amount, the exact location may not appear correct (e.g. the point might be over 
a body of water, etc.)


## CSV

File name: `csv/<site_id>.csv`

Each row of the file contains the following values:

    epoch timestamp, Date/ time, reading value, estimated indicator, anomaly indicator

The `estimated indicator` is a boolean indicating if the reading was estimated.  The
`anomaly indicator` is non-blank if the reading was erroneous.  Note also that the 
unit of measure for energy data is kWh in the CSV files.


## GreenButton XML

File name: `gb_xml/<site_id>.xml`

File contents:

A greenbutton XML of the same data that is in the CSV.
