#  Workshop on time series analytics at JOTB'19.

In this workshop we give a spin on time series analytics. In particular, we avoid the traditional
computation of statistics to focus on patterns, motifs, discords, shapelets and so on.
Many of the algorithms and use cases used in this workshop has been first published by the research team 
of Professor **Eamonn Keogh**.
