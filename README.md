#  Workshop on time series analytics at JOTB'19.

In this workshop we give a spin on time series analytics. In particular, we avoid the traditional
computation of statistics to focus on patterns, motifs, discords, shapelets and so on.
The majority of this work has been developed and published by the research team of Professor Eamonn Keogh.
